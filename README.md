[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CailinBellWold/README-Generator?style=plastic)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description 
Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

### Motivation
Streamlining each step of the programming process enables the developer to spend more time problem-solving and less time duplicating efforts. Automating the process of creating README.md files is one step in streamlining project development.git

### Learning Targets
This exercise furthered experience dynamically updating HTML and CSS using jQuery and introduced the Moment.js library to handle date and time.

## Core Objectives Met
1. (IN PROGRESS) Following the completion of prompts about an application's repository, the user is presented with a high-quality, professional README.md, generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
2. When a user enters the project title, it is displayed as the title of the README.
3. When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
4. (IN PROGRESS) When a user chooses a license for the application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
5. When a user enters their GitHub username, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile.
6. When a user enters their email address, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions. 
7. When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents,  then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
